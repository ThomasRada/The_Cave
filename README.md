# The_Cave
Simple text-based choose-your-own-adventure game using Python 2.7.

I hope you enjoy the game! 
The game is fully portable with just the .exe, or playable through a Python 2.7 interpreter. Please let me know at the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ThomasRada/The_Cave) if you have any issues or suggestions.

Feel free to distribute/modify/etc. as outlined in the MIT+Common Clause license.

POSSIBLE ISSUES:
- Sometimes The_Cave.exe's icon doesn't load properly.
  - Workaround: Icon (in Art Assets) can be replaced using [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/).  
    Alternatively, icon reloads itself when Resource Hacker is opened, perhaps out of fear of the repercussions of its insubordination.
